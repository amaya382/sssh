<h1 align="center">:closed_lock_with_key: Super SSH (SSSH)</h1>

A wrapper for interactive ssh clients

Keeping all the original ssh's features, you can use additional functions:

* :open_file_folder: Mount your local files to remote by the docker-like `--volume` option
* :clipboard: Clipboard over SSH
    * Copy text from your remote shell into your local clipboard
    * Paste text from your local clipboard into your remote shell
* :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: "Run commands in your local shell" from your remote shell

**No additional daemon or alternative command is needed! Just use `sssh` instead of `ssh`**



## :paperclip: Prerequisites
### Local
* `ssh` (or commands which have the same I/F as `ssh`)
* `openssh-sftp-server` (or other sftp servers compatible w/ `sshfs`)
* `xsel` or `pbcopy` or `xclip`

### Remote
* `sshfs`



## :trident: Features
### :open_file_folder: Mount your local files to remote
You can bring local files into remote by using a --volume option like the docker command's --volume option. It will be automatically mounted and unmounted by sshfs.

#### Usage
Add a `--volume` option,
```sh
sssh [<ssh_opts_if_need_be>] --volume <local_dir>:<remote_dir> <remote_host>
```


### :clipboard: Clipboard over SSH
You can copy text from a remote shell into a local clipboard.

#### Usage
No need extra care,
```console
$ sssh [<ssh_opts_if_need_be>] <remote_host>
```

##### Remote copy
And then, in the remote shell,
```console
$ echo -ne 'from remote to local\nüëç' | rcopy
```

Now

```
from remote to local
üëç
```

is in your local clipboard!
Of course, you can copy text from any tools (e.g., `tmux`, `vim`) by using `rcopy` command in your settings.

##### Remote paste
Yank text in the local desktop,
```
from local to remote
üëç
```

By `rpaste` command in the remote shell,
```console
$ rpaste
from local to remote
üëç
```


### :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: Transparent reverse command execution
You can run commands in your *local* shell from remote shell.

#### Usage
No need extra care,
```console
$ sssh [<ssh_opts_if_need_be>] <remote_host>
```

And then, in the remote shell,
```console
$ echo 'hostname' | reval
<your local hostname>
```
